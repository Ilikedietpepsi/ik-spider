To begin, download and extract ik-spider-main.zip. Open the extracted folder 
ik-spider-main as a Unity project in Unity Hub and select 2022.3.47f1 as the editor 
version. Later versions should also work, but if you run into issues then use the listed version. It 
should take a while to open the project for the first time. Once the project is opened, open the 
scene in Assets -> Scenes -> SampleScene.
